  # Simplify registration policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop all existing policies
    - Create simplified policies:
      - Allow anyone to insert registrations
      - Allow anyone to read their own registrations
      - Allow anyone to update their own registrations
  
  2. Security
    - Removes complex validation at RLS level
    - Maintains basic read/update restrictions
    - Validation handled by edge function instead
